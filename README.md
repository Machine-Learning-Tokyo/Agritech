A team of 15 Hardware and ML engineers are working on several MLT Agritech projects. After [visiting the Hackerfarm in Chiba](https://machinelearningtokyo.com/2019/07/17/mlt-team-visits-hackerfarm/) we conceptualized our first projects:

- Data Collection
- Suspended Robot
- Wild Animal Detection
- Urban Gardening
