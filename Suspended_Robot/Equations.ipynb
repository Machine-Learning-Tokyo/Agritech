    "- The four pulleys be $P_i | i \\in {1, 2, 3, 4}$.\n",

    "- Then, instead of $\\Delta\\Theta$, we can work with the total number of steps needed for each motor: $(N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4)$.\n",
    "- And we can break down the total number of steps a sequence of smaller steps where each motor moves one step, or not at all: $(1, 0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0), \\ldots$.\n",
    "- At each step, we ensure that the rope is taut (equation 12), and if any rope gets too much slack, prioritize rotating that pulley to accomodate make the rope taut."
