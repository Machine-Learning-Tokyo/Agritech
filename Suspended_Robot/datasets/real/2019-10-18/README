==========
Finally got all 4 controllers to run correctly for more than 5 minutes. Among the things that requires change:
- bad eternet connectors
- appropriate fans for the quick-to-heat-up controllers
- two controllers probably burnt out? They stop working after 5 minutes. Replaced them.

About the dataset:

- New type of lines: "f" lines (buggily adding an additional endline at the end, oh well...)
- "f" lines specify a timestamp and the arduino count of impulses since it started. Don't assume the same number of ticks imply the same position over different files. Only base your trainings on differences of pulses.
- "m" lines will soon be removed, can be ignored. In some cases they are even generated when the motors are stopped. Do not use them for anything.
- "p" lines are still generated by artoolkit. They still are in the same format: "p timestamp qw qx qy qz x y z"
